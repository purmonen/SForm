--Purpose
Make client-side form handling easier and remove redundancy.


--Ease-of-use
To make this as easy as possible client page should only
need to create an html form according to a certain structure
and then call the plugin.

--Customization
Error messages and styling should be decided entirely by the client page.


--Responsive validation
The most responsive way to handle form submissions is direct
validation. Whenever a client moves away from one field he should
be informed whether input was correct or incorrect.
